# Level 2 examples

These examples show how the analyzer behaves in Level 2 -- Analyzer Mode of
TrustInSoft Analyzer, as well as some of the options made to overcome false
alarms.

Each file shows some code and the command used to start an analysis on it. You
will also find either a `comments` directory with commentary on the code and
the Analyzer, or a `corrections` directory where the files have been modified
to now be handled correctly.
